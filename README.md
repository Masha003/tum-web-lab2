# Tech Book Club - Landing Page

A modern, responsive landing page for a tech book club, built as a lab project for web development course.

## Project Overview

Tech Book Club is designed to attract tech enthusiasts and developers by creating an inviting and interactive online space. The landing page guides users through a curated reading experience, offers multiple membership options, and provides community testimonialsâ€”all while maintaining a clean and modern aesthetic.

## Sections

- Hero Section: Features a compelling header with a call-to-action to invite users to join the community.
- Feature Sections: Showcases the benefits of joining the club, including curated book selections and exclusive community events.
- Tech Journey: Presents the steps to join the Tech Book Club. This section is hidden for mobile and tablet screens, and is visible on desktop.
- Membership Options: Details various membership tiers, including pricing and unique benefits.
- Testimonials: Displays feedback from community members to build trust and encourage engagement.

## Website Mascot

The Tech Book Club features an animated book character that bounces in the bottom-right corner of the screen. When users hover over the mascot, it displays a friendly welcome message inviting visitors to join the club.

## POC of Tailwind CSS framework

Tailwind makes development faster by offering ready-made style classes instead of writing custom CSS. It keeps designs consistent with standard spacing and colors, and makes responsive design easier.

However, adding Tailwind to an existing project might be harder. The utility classes might conflict with already implented CSS classes, causing styling problems. This is why I firstly renamed all existing classes to make sure that they all have custom names.
